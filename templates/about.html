         <p>
             &emsp;I am a person who tries to be positive about every aspect of life. 
             <br/>
             There are many things I like to do, to see, and to experience. I like to think and to dream. I like to see the sunrise in the morning and the moonlight at nights.
             <br/>
             I like to feel music flowing on my face. I like to look at the clouds in the sky with a blank mind and I like to do thought experiments when I cannot sleep in the middle of the night.
             <br/>
             I like to be alone. I like delicious food and comfortable shoes. I also like the land and the nature.
             <br/>
             <strong>And, I like to laugh.</strong>
